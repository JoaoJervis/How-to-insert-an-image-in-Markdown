Italics and Bold
We'll start by learning two basic elements in text formatting: italics and bold. In these lessons, you'll notice some ; this text is actually written in Markdown! Regular Markdown doesn't look any different than regular text, but we're providing some highlighting to make it easier to see.formatted red text

To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore

Example: _this word is in italic_

You can change words with two asterisks (*). This will make you see thicker words, **differents**.
    
Example: **bold**

To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (#). You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want. For example, for a header one, you'd use one hash mark (# Header One), while for a header three, you'd use three (### Header Three).

    You can't really make a header bold, but you can italicize certain words.
