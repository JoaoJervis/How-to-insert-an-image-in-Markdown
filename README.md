Italics and Bold. First let's learn two basic elements of text formatting: italics and bold. In these parts, you will probably notice some text written in Markdown. Regular Markdown is no different than regular text, but I'm providing some highlighted parts to make them easier to see.To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore

Example of Italic:

    _this word is in italic_

You can change words with two asterisks. This will make you see thicker words, **differents**
    
Example of Bold:

    **bold**

I've already talked about how to make words in italic and how to make words bold. Now I'm going to talk about how to put words in italics and bold at the same time. To do this, put two asterisks and an underscore at the beginning of the word and, in reverse order, at the end of the word (it is better to put the asterisks and the underscore in this order, because if you put it in the opposite order, the underscore and then you can't understand why the word is in italic and bold ) .

Example:

    **_italic and bold_**

To make headers in Markdown, start the sentence with a hashtag (#). To do this, place the same number of hashtag marks as the size of the header you want. For example, for a 1 header, you would use one hashtag (#Header 1), while for a 3 header, you would use three (###Header 3). I personally only know up to heading 6.

    You can't really make a header bold, but you can italicize certain words.

There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way. The first link style is called an inline link. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( ), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis (*).

You can also put links in words. The words turned blue and when you click on them you'll go somewhere, I'm sure you've see something like.
But you have to be careful about the links that tell you to click, especially if you don't know who told you to click on them. There is a way to find out which link they are
sending you to: you right-click and the last two options that appear are "View page source" (Ctrl + U) and "Inspect". If you click on "View page source" you will see it in html
and you will be able to find out what the link is. If you click on "View page source" in half of the tab the page will appear and the html page on the other half.
