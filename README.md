# How-to-insert-an-image-in-Markdown

We must start by writing ! [ and then we write the name we gave the photo, after that , at the end of the name we must by !] for example ! [Philadelphia's Magic Gardens. This 
place was so cool!] because we write the name of the place where the photo is on our computer, for example (/assets/images/philly-magic-gardens, and then we add .jpg or .png with 
form, and then we write the name of the photo again, but this time we write in quotes, and that's it.
