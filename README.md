Italics and Bold. First let's learn two basic elements of text formatting: italics and bold. In these parts, you will probably notice some text written in Markdown. Regular Markdown is no different than regular text, but I'm providing some highlighted parts to make them easier to see.To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore

Example of Italic:

    _this word is in italic_

You can change words with two asterisks. This will make you see thicker words, **differents**
    
Example:

    **bold**

To make headers in Markdown, start the sentence with a hashtag (#). To do this, place the same number of hashtag marks as the size of the header you want. For example, for a 1 header, you would use one hashtag tag (# Header 1), while for a 3 header, you would use three (### Header 3). I personally only know up to heading 6.

    You can't really make a header bold, but you can italicize certain words.

There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way. The first link style is called an inline link. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( ), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis (*).
